# Simulation-Of-Tools-Computer-Networks
This project demonstrates key networking concepts such as FTP server creation and IP blocking using FileZilla

Objective:
To understand and simulate the working of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and implement IP address blocking in a controlled network environment.

Features:

Created a custom FTP server for secure file sharing.

Implemented IP blocking to restrict unauthorized access.

Demonstrated real-time connection setup and file transfer.

Tools:

FTP protocol setup

Network simulation environment-FileZilla

IP configuration and access control

Learning Outcomes

Gained practical understanding of FTP communication.

Learned how to block and manage IP access.
