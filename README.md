# Simulation-Of-Tools-Computer-Networks
This project demonstrates key networking concepts such as FTP server creation and IP blocking using FileZilla

Objective:
To understand and simulate the working of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and implement IP address blocking in a controlled network environment.

Features:

1.Created a custom FTP server for secure file sharing.

2.Implemented IP blocking to restrict unauthorized access.

3.Demonstrated real-time connection setup and file transfer.

Tools:

1.FTP protocol setup

2.Network simulation environment-FileZilla

3.IP configuration and access control

Learning Outcomes

1.Gained practical understanding of FTP communication.

2.Learned how to block and manage IP access.
